### node version 16+
in case you don't have node installed already, I can recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) a Node Version Manager. It allows installing and switching between node version quite easily. 

Install it by executing the command mentioned in [Installing and updating](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

After that installing the latest version is as easy as executing
```shell
nvm install
```

You can verify the successful installation by asking 
```shell
node --version
# -> should equal the latest node version, v18.10.0 when this document was created

npm --version
# -> should equal the latest npm version, 8.19.2 when this document was created
```
